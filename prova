I would love to have the opportunity to come abroad from Spain to have new adventures and meet new people and maybe even get a Job sometime in computer Vision or AI, because of my intense passion about these topics.

The last hackathon my team and I won was a project focused on advancing techniques to facilitate health workers to diagnose patients with heart diseases. We fine-tuned a Mask RCNN model to train it to detect the aorta in patients, in specific detect whether the patients had any aneurysm. We also did a 3D model, a GUI and calculated the maximum diameter of the aorta.

To me, being able to make an impact in this world where it is so easy to just blend in, and go through life without bothering too much, I'd instead like to make a difference and make the world a better place, through my ideas and cooperating with teams of people.

I'm a bit of a keyboard nerd, one time I had to ask my mother for Lubricant, and syringes, admittedly I was given a weird look at first.
